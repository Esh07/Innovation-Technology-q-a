# Technology and Innovation Management
Welcome to the mock question and answer repository for the Technology and Innovation Management module (derived from Google Form).  This GitHub repository contains a collection of mock questions and answers for the Technology and Innovation Management module.

All of the practice questions from the module session are collected in this repository and are available in searchable form.

These practice questions were created by Module Convenor using a Google Form (currently unavailable).

Be aware that the answers to the questions are completely determined by the module convenor. As a result, if you google or something similar, you might find another option as an answer but it hasn't been verified by me yet (to be updated once I receive the feedback and response). So the repository currently relies entirely on the response from the Google Form.

Treat this resource as a valuable tool to enhance your understanding and test your knowledge.

Good luck with your mock tests!
