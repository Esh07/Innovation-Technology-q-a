# Innovation Technology Module

This repo is composition of all the questions that were practiced during the module session is in search form with question and answer only. 

These are Google Form based questions for practice created by Module conevnor (Currently it's unavilable). 

Be aware that the questions' answer are purely followed on the answer set by convenor. So if you chatGPT or somethin, you might come accross another option as answer but it's not yet verified by me (to be updated once I receive result and answer). SO currently, the repo is completly rely on Google Form's answer.
