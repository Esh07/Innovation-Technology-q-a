# Innovation Technology Module

All of the practise questions from the module session are collected in this repository and are available in searchable form. 

These practise questions were created by Module Convenor using a Google Form (currently unavailable). 

Be aware that the answers to the questions are completely determined by the convenor. As a result, if you google or something similar, you might find another option as an answer but it hasn't been verified by me yet (to be updated once I receive the result and response). So the repository currently relies entirely on the response from the Google Form. 

## How to Contribute
Currently, you can only contribute to the project by adding new questions and answers. Please keep in mind that only the `questions.json` (you can find at root directory) file can be modified in the pull request; otherwise, your PR will be closed automatically. 

Make sure to keep the question and answer in the same format.
